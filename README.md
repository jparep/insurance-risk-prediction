# Insurance Risk Regression Model

## Overview
The **Insurance Risk Regression Model** is a data-driven project designed to predict insurance-related risks and costs. It uses regression techniques to analyze historical insurance data, enabling better decision-making for policy pricing, risk assessment, and claim prediction.

This project is ideal for actuaries, data scientists, and insurance analysts seeking to build and deploy predictive models in the insurance domain.
